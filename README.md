I have created this project to help my dear friend with auto downloading chemistry analysis data from specific bot.

Don't really know what his bot is..

### To set up this project you need to:

1. Clone it to your pc
```
git clone https://github.com/pxc1984/downloader-telethon
cd downloader-telethon
```

2. Create venv
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. Switch to venv
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Download all libraries from requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run program
```
./main.py
```
